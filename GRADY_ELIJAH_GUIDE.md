There is certain information you'll have to update to use the model. I'm very high while writing this, but let me do this with the
smallest bit of sobreity so that I may get you all on your way

1. UPDATE THE config/DUAL_RNN/train_rnn.yml TO THE APPROPIATE PARAMETERS. MAKE SURE TO UPDATE THE PATHS IN THE FILE AS WELL. CHOOSE IF YOU WISH TO
CONTINUE ON MAC OR MOVE TO PC. WHICHEVER CHOICE, YOU'LL HAVE TO UPDATE THE PARAMETERS

2. UPDATE THE Dataset.py FILE PATHS!! THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR THE TRAINING AS IT WILL BE PULLING FROM THE PROVIDED DATASETS. 
REMEMBER, YOU NEED 7 PATHS, AS YOU HAVE SIX CHORDS AND A MIXED AUDIO FILE

3. GETTING PRETTY HIGH NOW.

4. IN FACT, MAKE SURE TO LOOK AT EACH FILE IN THE data_loader/ FOLDER AND MAKE SURE ALL OF YOUR FILE PATHS ARE APPROPIATELY THERE

5. MAKE SURE TO FOLLOW THE GITHUB INSTRUCTIONS FIRST, BY LOADING THE scp FILES FIRST, then TRAINING.
